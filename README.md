# Beer Booking

This is my personal project that i build a simple CRUD is Beer Registration and to build this project i used PHP, Laravel, MySQL and inside of Laragon.
Basically each route make a function in this application and makes create, read, update or delete beer of the registration and i will explanation below each routes and what they do.


#Routes
* '/new-spirit' it's my first route of my application where you can make new register of the beer in the system

* /edit-spirit/{id} it's the second route where you can edit the register in the system filter by id, ex: id=3 the return will correspond to id 3 in the database

* /delete/{id} its the third route and you can delete the register of the system based on the id you are put on the navigator ex: /delete/4.

* lastly the route where to show all the beer of the registration in the navigator /to-show, and also have an option to show in the navigator only beer in the registration using this route:/to-show/{id}.

I used in this aplication the MVC and best pratices for code in PHP
